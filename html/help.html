                <p>Welcome to the help page for <span class="join">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project
                    management
                    tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what <span class="join">Join</span> is, how it can benefit
                    you,
                    and
                    how
                    to use it.</p>

                <h2>What is Join?</h2>

                <p><span class="join">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
                    group of
                    dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>

                <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                    work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="join">Join</span> leverages the
                    principles
                    of
                    kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>

                <p>It is important to note that <span class="join">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise
                    and is
                    not
                    intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience,
                    we
                    cannot
                    guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding
                    <span class="join">Join</span>.</p>

                <h2>How to use it</h2>

                <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="join">Join</span>:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <div class="number-and-headline">
                            <span class="number">1.</span>
                            <span class="headline">Exploring the Board</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>When you log in to <span class="join">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board
                            represents
                            your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and
                            "Done".
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="number-and-headline">
                            <span class="number">2.</span>
                            <span class="headline">Creating Contacts</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>In <span class="join">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go
                            to
                            the
                            "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once
                            added,
                            these
                            contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="number-and-headline">
                            <span class="number">3.</span>
                            <span class="headline">Adding Cards</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                            tasks.
                            Click
                            the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
                            the
                            card,
                            like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="number-and-headline">
                            <span class="number">4.</span>
                            <span class="headline">Moving Cards</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging
                            and
                            dropping
                            the card from one list to another.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="number-and-headline">
                            <span class="number">5.</span>
                            <span class="headline">Deleting Cards</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
                            card
                            will
                            permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                            action is
                            irreversible.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Remember that using <span class="join">Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from you
                    and
                    your
                    team
                    to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.</p>
