				<p>Welcome to the help page for <span class="join">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project
				management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what <span class="join">Join</span> is, how it
				can benefit you, and how to use it.</p>
				<p class="sub-headline">What is Join?</p>
				<p><span class="join">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
				group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
				<p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
				work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="join">Join</span> leverages the
				principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
				interface.</p>
				<p>It is important to note that <span class="join">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise
				and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user
				experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of
				quality regarding <span class="join">Join</span>.</p>
				<p class="sub-headline">How to use it</p>

							<span class="sub-sub-headline">Exploring the Board</span>
							<p>When you log in to <span class="join">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This
							board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress",
							“Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
						</div>

					<li class="li-flexbox">
						<div class="number-and-headline">
							<span class="number">2.</span>
						</div>
						<div class="li-text">
							<span class="sub-sub-headline">Creating Contacts</span>
							<p>In <span class="join">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects.
							Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required
							information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with
							the tasks on the board.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="number-and-headline">
							<span class="number">3.</span>
						</div>
						<div class="li-text">
							<span class="sub-sub-headline">Adding Cards</span>
							<p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
							individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card.
							Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
							etc.</p>
						</div>

					<li class="li-flexbox">
						<div class="number-and-headline">
							<span class="number">5.</span>
						</div>
						<div class="li-text">
							<span class="sub-sub-headline">Deleting Cards</span>
							<p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
							Deleting a card will permanently remove it from
							the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible. <br>
							<br>


							Remember that using <span class="join">Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to
							ensure the board reflects the
							current state of your project. <br>
